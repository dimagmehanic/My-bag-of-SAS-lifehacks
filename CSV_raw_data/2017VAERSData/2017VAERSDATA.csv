The patient had immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) post-splenectomy who presented with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, increased white count and drop in platelets to 58. He was admitted to the ICU and required vasopressors for hemodynamic instability. He had streptococcus pneumonia bacteremia even after immunization with pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) before his splenectomy (Vaccination failure and Pneumococcal sepsis). His lower extremities developed purpura fulminans-like rash possibly secondary to streptococcus pneumonia bacteremia and gangrenous wounds on lower extremities which warranted amputation due to concern for non-viable necrotic tissue. He was later found to have common variable immune deficiency (CVID) with low levels of IgG, IgA and IgM in his blood on evaluation for recurrent respiratory tract infections. It was reported that, ITP could be the presenting symptom of CVID and hence it may not be unreasonable to test for immunoglobulin levels on diagnosis of ITP. In this patient, inadequate response to the pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) due to co-existing CVID may have resulted in overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis. Adequate gamma-globulin replacements before proceeding with vaccinations could have helped. At the time of this report, the outcome of the events was unknown.

Within an hour my arm was sore and a lump had developed around the injection site. The soreness interrupted my sleep and worsened throughout the night. October 1, 2016-After getting up I had increasing discomfort in both arms and my lower back and hips. It was the day of our town-wide garage sale and lower-back pain caused walking to become so painful that I returned home and went to bed, where I remained for two days. I developed a fever and aching pain around and behind my right eye. I was mildly nauseated and had little appetite. October 2, 2016-The pain intensified, I could not sleep because of the back, leg and pain in both shoulder. My joints became so stiff that I could not bend over, step into the tub or dress myself. My fatigue was so overwhelming that I could barely move and I felt depressed. October 4, 2016-The fever went away, my eye stopped hurting. But the pain continued, and I had cramps in my legs. Extreme fatigue and depression continued. I assumed it was a reaction to the shot which would run its course. Yet it continued, the pain altering somewhat in its location and severity over the next two weeks. Friday, October 14, 2016-I called Dr.'s office and described my symptom to the Nurse, asking her to relay them to Dr. His response was that my symptoms were most likely a flu-shot reaction and instructed me to take TYLENOL and check in on Monday, October 17. On Monday, October 17, I felt for the first time as if the symptoms were measurably improved, and informed Dr's office of that. I was preparing for a trip north which would last for at least two weeks. Unfortunately the improvement I experienced was simply the beginning of a pattern in which the symptoms appear to be dissipating only to return stronger than ever. Sleep was nearly impossible as pain in both shoulders and my hips and back was worsened with each movement. The stiffness and muscle soreness would appear to be lessening for several days only to return in full force, once again flattening me with pain, restricted motion, fatigue, depression and generalized discomfort. I cut my northern visit short to return as I was now concerned that whatever was causing my symptoms might be degenerative. November 18, 2016-I had an appointment with Dr. He performed an evaluation, ordered blood work, and prescribed Prednisone. The Prednisone alleviated my symptoms. November 28, 2016-Appointment with Dr. who diagnosed my condition as Polymyalgia Rheumatica. I am to return to his office for a follow-up on January 9, 2017.",,,,Y,,,,,U,09/30/2016,09/30/2016,0,See attached lab results and doctor's note,OTH,OTH,,,,,

The following is verbatim from the article: Abstract: Introduction: This is the 33rd Annual Report. As of 1 January 2015, 55 of the nation's poison centers (PCs) uploaded case data automatically to database. The upload interval was 9.52 [7.40, 13.6] (median [25%, 75%]) minutes, creating a near real-time national exposure and information database and surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed the case data tabulating specific indices from the database. The methodology was similar to that of previous years. Where changes were introduced, the differences are identified. Poison center cases with medical outcomes of death were evaluated by a team of medical and clinical toxicologist reviewers using an ordinal scale of 1-6 to assess the Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) of the exposure. Results: In 2015, 2,792,130 closed encounters were logged by NPDS: 2,168,371 human exposures, 55,516 animal exposures, 560,467 information calls, 7657 human confirmed non-exposures, and 119 animal confirmed non-exposures. PCs also made 2,695,699 follow-up calls in 2015. Total encounters showed a 3.42% decline from 2014, while healthcare facility (HCF) human exposure cases increased by 5.09% from 2014. All information calls decreased by 15.5% but HCF information calls increased 2.67%, and while medication identification requests (Drug ID) decreased 31.7%, human exposures reported to PCs were essentially flat, increasing by 0.149%. Human exposures with less serious outcomes have decreased 2.95% per year since 2008 while those with more serious outcomes (moderate, major or death) have increased by 4.34% per year since 2000. The top 5 substance classes most frequently involved in all human exposures were analgesics (11.1%), household cleaning substances (7.54%), cosmetics/personal care products (7.41%), sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics (5.83%), and antidepressants (4.58%). Sedative/Hypnotics/Antipsychotics exposures as a class increased the most rapidly (2597 calls (11.4%)/year) over the last 14 years for cases showing more serious outcomes. The top 5 most common exposures in children age 5 years or less were cosmetics/ personal care products (13.6%), household cleaning substances (11.2%), analgesics (9.12%), foreign bodies/toys/miscellaneous (6.45%), and topical preparations (5.33%). Drug identification requests comprised 35.0% of all information calls. Database documented 1831 human exposures resulting in death with 1371 human fatalities judged related (RCF of 1-Undoubtedly responsible, 2-Probably responsible, or 3-Contributory). Conclusions: These data support the continued value of PC expertise and need for specialized medical toxicology information to manage more serious exposures, despite a decrease in calls involving less serious exposures. Unintentional and intentional exposures continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The near real-time, always current status of database represents a national public health resource to collect and monitor exposure cases and information calls. The continuing mission of database is to provide a nationwide infrastructure for surveillance for all types of exposures (e.g., foreign body, viral, bacterial, venomous, chemical agent, or commercial product), the identification of events of public health significance, resilience, response and situational awareness tracking. Database is a model system for the real-time surveillance of national and global public health.

677109,01/06/2017,ND,50.0,50,,F,01/06/2017,"Even as it was administered, this year's flu shot was unusually painful to me. At the time, I thought that perhaps the pain I felt was still within the normal range and may have been caused by the particular combination of chemicals in this years vaccine. After I received the flu shot, I headed back to work. Within 3-4 hours, I was in extreme pain whenever I tried to use my left arm. I remember audibly gasping in pain multiple times when I unthinkingly moved my left arm while meeting with my undergraduate research assistant that afternoon.  The pain continued, and I continued to brush it off as just an inconvenience that will surely go away soon. My first suspicion that something might be wrong was when my husband, son, and mother-in-law, all of whom received the flu shot a few days after I did, were, unlike me, all feeling fine and reporting no pain. It also gave me pause when my daughter, who had received the flu shot a few days before I did and had mentioned a sore arm afterwards, was astonished at the level of pain I was feeling even several days after receiving the shot. A week after I had received the flu shot, the pain was still there and even getting worse instead of better. At that point I decided that this cannot be within the normal range. I called the ask-a-nurse hotline to learn what I should be doing or not doing to help my arm start to heal. I was not sure if I should put ice packs or hot pads on my arm, and I was not sure if it would be better to try to move it despite the pain or to avoid moving it. The nurse advised me to contact my physician. I immediately called my internist's office asking for advice. They called me back later and advised me to take pain killers and to call them again after two weeks if the pain still persisted by then. I soon discovered that I could not wait that long. The pain became debilitating, and I became scared that I might suffer a permanent loss of functioning in my arm.  A couple of days after calling my internist, I asked my husband to call a friend who is a physician for further advice. He suggested that I see an orthopedist. The next morning, I went into the walk-in orthopedics clinic and saw an orthopedist. He prescribed Celebrex, a strong anti-inflammatory medication for 1-2 months maximum because of concerns about my liver functioning, given that I am already on another medication (Methimazole for Graves' disease) that could damage my liver. Celebrex helped with the pain, but I could not take it for more than a month because it gave me headaches so severe that they caused me to wake up in pain. Sometimes the headaches caused me to have to leave work and seek rest in bed in a dark room in the middle of the day. These headaches were worrisome to me because, normally, I rarely have headaches at all. When I stopped taking Celebrex, the headaches stopped, but the pain in my left shoulder returned the very next day and was worse than ever. Shortly after I stopped taking Celebrex, I saw my internist for an annual exam. I mentioned to her that I was really worried about the worsening pain in my shoulder. Because of the pain, I was unable to sleep through the night, had to enlist my husband for help in dressing myself and was even struggling to drive. These disruptions to my life were making me wonder if I should just go back to taking the Celebrex despite the headaches it gave me. She examined me and determined that I probably had a rotator cuff injury. She recommended that I see a physical therapist and switch back to over-the counter pain killers. I immediately scheduled sessions with a physical therapist. The first couple of sessions were fine, but after the fourth visit, the pain in my shoulder was worse. When I again found that I was in more pain after my fifth visit, I visited the orthopedist for another appointment. He advised me to stop the physical therapy since it had not helped and to have an MRI to find out what was going on.

About 8:30 realized I was maybe having a slight reaction to the vaccine, typical, so took a shower and readied for bed.  While in shower, back muscles started spasming and cramping.

Fever, chills, body aches continued to the next day.  Sunday the fever was mostly gone and I felt much more myself, but could not move leg normally.  I could not stand even brushing anywhere on my entire thigh muscle, and a rash appeared right above my inner knee.  Ibuprofin useless.

On October 31st 1/2 of my tongue felt odd on the way home from work and I had a severe headache almost enough to pull over and vomit. I got home and went to bed and woke up at 9:30 am the next morning unable to close my right eye and my right side of my face drooped and a horrid headache. I thought I was having an aneurysm or stroke so I called 911. After blood work and a CT Scan I was DX with bells palsy. I  was started on  an antiviral and prednisone and given Norco 5/325mg. I returned to work about 10 days later after following up with an ENT and my primary Dr.  I continued to have increasing symptons. Numbness in my left arm and tingling and jolts down my left arm. My pulse would run up into the 130's and my BP up into the 140/96. My BP is normally 115/70.

I was taken down to the ER and told I just had a syncope episode and sent home. Headaches continued as well as the numbness and my left arm. I believe on the 17th of December my right arm started to go numb and the chest pains and severe headaches continued so I went to the ER and was admitted for a stroke workup. 3 days later I was discharged with no answers. My Primary Dr had let me know I had a vitamin b12 deficiency, my level is 232 and should be up around 450. Vit B12 deficiency has a lot of the symptoms I have been experiencing.  So I started a supplement. Now the question is why am i deficient A. Stomach stapled = No B. Bowel surgery = No C. Autoimmune disease stirred up by something viral that could have caused the bells palsy and this deficiency.
